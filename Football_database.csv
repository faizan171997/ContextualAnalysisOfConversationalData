thread 1,Hey did you know that ISL is cutting down on foreign players
thread 1,I wonder how interesting it will make the game of football
thread 1,I dont even consider ISL as a legit league
thread 1,Its all about the money but nothing about the game 
thread 1,Foget it are you seeing the premier league matches which are going on
thread 1,Yes definitely all eyes on liverpool i really want them to win
thread 1,Machester city is their biggest competitor right now and i dont know if they will loose any watch of the remaining ones 
thread 1,Machester city is a club with no history it only has risen because of the tremendous investment which has been put in by its owners
thread 1,Money shoudl never be the only parameter because of which a club succeeds
thread 1,Thats why my heart goes out to liverpool they are a self made club they make their own stars not buy them from another club
thread 1,Yes thats what makes them special and that is why they are the second most successfull club in the premeir league
thread 1,What do you think about international football i think it has completely lost its place 
thread 1,Yes i think football is the only game in which the domestic league overshadows the international matches 
thread 1,No one cares to see international football unless it is the world cup 
thread 1,Yes even Messi decided to retire from international football and not from club football 
thread 1,If he was really tired of the game he should have quit all forms of it 
thread 1,Money speaks bro there is a lot of money invested in club football some players even have stakes in the teams which they play in
thread 1,Internationally they just dont feel the glamour of the play which they see in club football
thread 1,Yes even on their grounds they have stands named after them
thread 1,And in club football they can easily switch clubs if they are not happy with their particular manager or team
thread 1,That is something which can never be done in international football you cannot change your country
thread 1,This mistake was done by diego costa he used to play for brazil but knowing that if Neymar is there theres no chance of hin playing as a forward he switched to spain
thread 1,I remember when it was brazil vs spain and the whole crowd went after diego costa whenever he had the ball there would loud boose coming from the audience side
thread 1,Christiano ronaldo should i beleive should not have switched from madrid to juventus 
thread 1,Hes playing well and is the top scorer but its just that international fan following for juventus is not that great so a large part of the world is not even seeing Chrisitano ronaldo play as they dont follow that league
thread 1,Ronaldo thought considering his age it will be better to play in a less competitive league and stay on top
thread 1,Or atleast create an illusion of being the best in the world 
thread 1,That is why i like messi he does not fear competition and i think he will end his career at barca only
thread 1,yes even i think so because messi has been an academy player for barcelona for so long all his life he has been a member of barcelona
thread 2,Yes but you never know football is a strange world.
