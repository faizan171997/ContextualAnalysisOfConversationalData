Thread 1,Can you tell me about the important cricket positions or roles 
Thread 1,The captain – the most responsible position in the side. The captain usually has a say in the selection of the team. He or she is responsible for making the call (either to bat or bowl first) at the toss of the coin before the start of the match. The captain also sets out the tactics by telling his fielders where to position themselves.
Thread 1,"The wicketkeeper – one of the biggest positions of responsibility. The wicketkeeper is responsible for retrieving the ball every time almost every time it is bowled, unless it has been hit to another part of the field by the batter. He or she must be on their toes to take every ball that comes their way."
Thread 1,Bowlers – are responsible for taking wickets by bowling the batter out. They must bowl consistently to prevent the batsmen scoring easy runs. A bowler usually bowls six balls before the next bowler on his side has his turn from the other end of the cricket ground.
Thread 1,Batsmen or batswomen – are responsible for scoring the runs when it is their turn to bat. They must seize upon the bad deliveries from bowlers and protect their stumps at all times.
Thread 1,What are some trending technologies in the market

Thread 1,"Machine Learning is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: They literally learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised."
Thread 1,"Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors and CEOs."
Thread 1,"Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only add to, not take away from or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, as explained in this Forbes article, so no one entity can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions."
Thread 1,"Formerly a technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But it’s no longer the emerging technology. Edge is. Move over, cloud computing, and make way for the edge."
Thread 1,"Virtual Reality (VR) immerses the user in an environment while Augment Reality (AR) enhances their environment. Although VR has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with VirtualShip, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship captains. The popular Pokemon Go is an example of AR."
Thread 1,"Cyber security might not seem like emerging technology, given that it has been around for a while, but it is evolving just as other technologies are. That’s in part because threats are constantly new. The malevolent hackers who are trying to illegally access data are not going to give up any time soon, and they will continue to find ways to get through even the toughest security measures. It’s also in part because new technology is being adapted to enhance security. Three of those advancements are hardware authentication, cloud technology, and deep learning, according to one expert. Another adds data loss prevention and behavioral analytics to the list. As long as we have hackers, we will have cyber security as an emerging technology because it will constantly evolve to defend against those hackers."
Thread 1,"Although it sounds like a game you’d play on your smartphone, the Internet of Things (IoT) is the future. Many “things” are now being built with WiFi connectivity, meaning they can be connected to the Internet—and to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT. IoT enables devices, home appliances, cars and much more to be connected to and exchange data over the Internet. And we’re only in the beginning stages of IoT: The number of IoT devices reached 8.4 billion in 2017 is and expected to reach 30 billion devices by 2020."
Thread 1,Great. I think it’s been seven years or so since we first sat down.
Thread 1,That’s right. And-- I guess-- that was before I was CEO. That’s right.
Thread 1,"Yes, before you were CEO. We go way back, you know."
Thread 1,"Not just the-- I’ve never seen, that I can recall, an executive go from “Who’s he?” to, “No, this guy knows what’s going on, and he is at the center of the zeitgeist,” quite the way I’ve seen you do it. Is it weird?"
Thread 1,"If you say so. I mean, I-- I don’t find any difference, but you know, it’s been a-- it’s been a fantastic ride. I mean, I think what’s been humbling for me is I-- I don’t get confused, this is all because of the platform I’ve been given, which is it’s Microsoft and the work we do. It’s not me-- but it’s the opportunity I’ve been given."
Thread 1,"At -- at what point do you say, and I know this isn’t a turnaround, this is hitting refresh, and there’s still work to do, as you said in the book, but Microsoft’s stock is near all-time highs, in the mid-’90s-- recently. At what point can you say, “Yeah, we’ve-- we’ve got that part behind us. The turnaround, or the refresh, or whatever you wanna call it, there’s still more to do, but yeah, good job, team. Now it’s time to take the next hill.”"
Thread 2,"I mean, I think that’s the fundamental posture that we have to have. And quite frankly, any company that needs to continue to renew itself needs to have. Because if you think about it, the-- what’s gonna happen next, and the day after, is what-- you have to anticipate. So what has happened in the past is just the past."
Thread 3,"Is Phase One done? Can you kind of say, “Hey, I’ve been CEO for four-ish years now, and yeah, we-- we got that part done, pretty good job.”"
